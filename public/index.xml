      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we docked in our final stop on the cruise,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen&#34;&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;, the third largest city in Norway&#xA;with a population of about 300,000. It feels somewhat strange to be in a city&#xA;again after so much time in much more rural areas. Bergen has a rich history and&#xA;Jessica and I spent the day just walking around taking in the sights and&#xA;visiting a couple of the museums.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first museum was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sjofartsmuseum.museumvest.no/en&#34;&gt;maritime&#xA;museum&lt;/a&gt;, which had a history of&#xA;Norwegian shipbuilding from Viking era ships to modern cruise ships. I really&#xA;liked this one, the Vikings had an innovative shipbuilding style with a very&#xA;shallow draft, that allowed them to sail their ocean-going ships up and down&#xA;rivers. This allowed them to, for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Paris_(845)&#34;&gt;attack&#xA;Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 845.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we were in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidsdal&#34;&gt;Eidsdal&lt;/a&gt;, and it was&#xA;definitely the most beautiful day of the trip so far. The weather was sunny an&#xA;nearing 80 degrees. Eidsdal is a very small farming town, without a port big&#xA;enough to accommodate our ship. So to visit, we anchored at sea, and there were&#xA;periodic tender boats (basically our lifeboats) shuttling folks to shore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main activity for the day was a self-organized hike. Jessica joined for the&#xA;first part, and fed some sheep that we passed the good stuff that they had&#xA;cleared from their pasture and couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach through the fence. But after a&#xA;while she decided to head back and get a little more rest and recovery today,&#xA;especially given the steepness and poor footing of the trail we were on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not much to say today, we were at sea all day and Jessica and I mostly spent it&#xA;resting. Last night we crossed back below the Arctic circle and we have been&#xA;rewarded with fantastic weather. Blue skies and temperatures in the 70s. For the&#xA;first time on the trip, the roof over the pool deck was retracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had said I would talk through the upper decks of the ship, so let me start at&#xA;the aft of deck 6. The very aft is open to the sky and has a hot tub and&#xA;infinity pool. It also has seating for the &amp;ldquo;Aquavit Lounge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;World Cafe&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;which are just forward once you step inside. The World Cafe is a large&#xA;buffet-style restaurant, and is where we have most of our meals. There is always&#xA;a very wide selection of food, with salads, bread and cheese, and a wide variety&#xA;of great choices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Once we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten our food&#xA;and taken a seat, a very attentive staff shows up to provide us with drinks and&#xA;take our old plates as we inevitably go back for more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025-07-11 Lofoten</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you ask a Northern European where the most beautiful place to see the fjords&#xA;are, the standard answer will be&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofoten&#34;&gt;Lofoten&lt;/a&gt;. This is a chain of islands&#xA;extending off the western coast of Norway, just above the Arctic circle. They&#xA;are connected by roads and tunnels to each other and the mainland, with the main&#xA;road spanning a bit more than 100 miles, with an estimated driving time of three&#xA;hours. This distance is populated by about 24,000 people who see and serve more&#xA;than 1 million tourists every year. The two largest municipalities are&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leknes&#34;&gt;Leknes&lt;/a&gt;, with a population of a little&#xA;under 4,000 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svolv%C3%A6r&#34;&gt;Svolvaer&lt;/a&gt;, with&#xA;closer to 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025-07-10 Narvik</title>
      <link>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-07-10-narvik/</link>

      <guid>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-07-10-narvik/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narvik_Municipality&#34;&gt;Narvik&lt;/a&gt; is a small mining&#xA;community on the shores of a fjord known as Ofotfjorden. If I understood our&#xA;guide correctly, several hundred thousand tons of ore are exported by ship every&#xA;day. It was heavily attacked by the Germans in World War 2, who were attempting&#xA;to gain control of the mines, and there are many memorials and a large war&#xA;museum in town. As with everywhere in the north country, tourism is growing in&#xA;importance, and there is currently work being done on the ski mountain just&#xA;above town to make it suitable for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Alpine_World_Ski_Championships&#34;&gt;World Alpine Ski&#xA;Championships&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;that Narvik will host in 2029.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s adventure was in and around the city of&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8&#34;&gt;Tromsö&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced Troom-suh).&#xA;Considered &amp;ldquo;the capital of the north&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s a thriving city of about 80,000&#xA;people roughly equally divided into three main job categories: fishing,&#xA;government services (including the university), and tourism. It is the&#xA;northernmost city in the world with more than 50,000 people, and so has &amp;ldquo;the&#xA;furthest north McDonald&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the furthest north shopping mall&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still north of the arctic circle, Tromsö, like everywhere we&amp;rsquo;ve been, sits in&#xA;the Gulf Stream and so the climate is much more moderate than places of similar&#xA;latitude like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay,_Alaska&#34;&gt;Prudhoe Bay&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;Apparently, temperatures typically remain above 10°F in the winter and get up to&#xA;roughly 75°F in the summer. That said, the first snowfall is typically in early&#xA;October, and the last in late April or early May. Overcast skies and frequent&#xA;precipitation are common.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-07-08-honningsvag/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 12:36:27 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-07-08-honningsvag/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honningsv%C3%A5g&#34;&gt;Honningsvåg&lt;/a&gt; is a small fishing&#xA;village on an island just off the northern tip of Norway. By a political quirk,&#xA;it is classified as a city (unlike Longyearbyen), making it the northernmost&#xA;city in Europe. The island is connected to the mainland by a tunnel, making it&#xA;possible to drive from here to anywhere in mainland Europe. It&amp;rsquo;s at 71°, as far&#xA;north as northernmost Alaska, but the climate is much warmer due to the gulf&#xA;stream. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s beyond the tree line, so the entire landscape is tundra,&#xA;with lichen, grass, some very small shrubs and not much else. Like all of&#xA;Norway&amp;rsquo;s northern fjord lands, dramatic mountains are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another sea day today. I spent some time nature watching over the side of the&#xA;ship. The most common sight is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_fulmar&#34;&gt;Northern&#xA;fulmar&lt;/a&gt;. These look like gulls,&#xA;their name even means &amp;ldquo;foul gull&amp;rdquo; due to their defense mechanism of spitting&#xA;terrible smelling stomach juices at perceived threats. But in fact, they are&#xA;members of the petrel family. They are highly efficient fliers &amp;ndash; our guide on&#xA;the boat tour claimed that in the right conditions they can use less energy&#xA;gliding over the water than standing still on land. They are always several of&#xA;them playing around near our ship, no doubt enjoying the unusual things it must&#xA;do to the air, though I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen one land on deck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025-07-06 Longyearbyen</title>
      <link>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-07-06-longyearbyen/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s scheduled excursion was a catamaran fjord safari. We followed this up&#xA;with a visit to the Svalbard museum, and a final walk around town before&#xA;returning to the ship for our 5pm on board time. We also had an 8pm reservation&#xA;at &amp;ldquo;The Chef&amp;rsquo;s Table&amp;rdquo;, billed as the nicest restaurant on board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The catamaran had nearly 90 of us onboard, although with two decks there was&#xA;plenty of seating. It was chilly on the outer decks, especially with the wind,&#xA;but easy to warm up when back inside. The plan was to head north across the&#xA;large Isfjord to an area where glaciers come down to the water&#xA;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.app.goo.gl/dFHWxtHXNwKc92SP7&#34;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;). There were no guarantees&#xA;what we might see, but it was likely that we would see something. The plan was&#xA;to be flexible to explore whatever presented itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025-07-05 Longyearbyen</title>
      <link>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-07-05-longyearbyen/</link>

      <guid>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-07-05-longyearbyen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we sailed into the town of&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen&#34;&gt;Longyearbyen&lt;/a&gt; on the island of&#xA;Spitsbergen in the archipelago of&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard&#34;&gt;Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;. Svalbard is halfway between&#xA;the northern tip of Norway and the north pole, and is the furthest north&#xA;location with permanent human settlements. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly large, with an area&#xA;roughly the size of West Virginia. It was historically a port for whalers, and&#xA;from the late nineteenth through the early 21st century was an important mining&#xA;community. The capital city of Longyearbyen (Norwegian for &amp;ldquo;The City of&#xA;Longyear&amp;rdquo;) was founded by and named for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Munro_Longyear&#34;&gt;John&#xA;Longyear&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in&#xA;Lansing, MI, and revolutionized mining techniques in the Iron Mountain area of&#xA;the Upper Peninsula. He founded an important mining company that had success&#xA;here. In his later life, he moved to Massachusetts, eventually dying in&#xA;Brookline, the community where Jessica was born. We are here overnight with a&#xA;&amp;ldquo;back on board&amp;rdquo; time of five pm tomorrow, giving us a chance to enjoy the&#xA;midnight sun if we so choose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 4th of July was very much a &amp;ldquo;ship day&amp;rdquo;. No land or other ships would have&#xA;been visible all day, even if visibility had been perfect, which it very much&#xA;was not. The captain gives a daily announcement at noon with general conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From today&amp;rsquo;s announcement:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We are at 74&#39;39&amp;quot; North, 0&#39;28&amp;quot; West, in the Greenland Sea&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Current temperature is 46 degrees F&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We still have some whales following us&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The sea is calm&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is an overcast sky with patchy fog&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, on that last point, we heard the foghorn blow intermittently&#xA;throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was our first day with no stop on land. To keep up with time zones, we set&#xA;our clocks forward one hour overnight. We will do the same again tomorrow, so&#xA;our two days at see are really only 23 hour days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly a sunny day, with temperatures around 50. Reports of whales near the&#xA;boat, though I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen any yet. I saw spray and a splash of color&#xA;once when I was running on the treadmill, but it could easily have been a&#xA;porpoise, which are also in the area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Woke up early, and after waking up I spent an hour on the treadmill. It was&#xA;extremely disorienting to be looking out the window as the ship was slewing&#xA;into port while running. But if I looked at a fixed point it was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Dsafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur&#34;&gt;Isafjordur&lt;/a&gt; is the&#xA;largest town in the west fjords, with a population of about 3000. It&amp;rsquo;s about a&#xA;6 hour drive from Reykjavik, 30 minutes by plane. Fishing and tourism are the&#xA;biggest industries, but all of the government services (hospitals, court, etc.)&#xA;for the west fjords are located there, so the government is another major&#xA;employer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After another fantastic breakfast, I returned the rental car without issue and&#xA;walked back to the hotel. We packed our luggage, left it at the desk and walked&#xA;to the Iceland Museum, where we spent a few hours looking at artifacts from the&#xA;time of settlement to about 1700.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After walking back to the hotel, we took a taxi to the ships terminal, where we&#xA;were apparently the last people to be boarding. We went through the otherwise&#xA;empty check in process in a few short minutes and were quickly exploring the&#xA;ship. Our cabin is at the very aft of the ship on the port side, 6th deck (the&#xA;highest floor that is only cabins).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we were both up, we enjoyed an amazing breakfast at the hotel. This was&#xA;an open buffet of bread, sliced meats, smoked salmon, salad, yoghurts, etc.,&#xA;with an included carafe of coffee. Given Icelandic prices, we could easily have&#xA;had the equivalent of a $100 meal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After some discussion, we decided our plan for the day was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://siggadottir.com/reykjadalur-hot-springs/&#34;&gt;Reykjadalur Hot&#xA;Springs Hike&lt;/a&gt;. After getting&#xA;sorted, we left around 11:30 for&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hverager%C3%B0i,+Iceland/&#34;&gt;Hveragerdi&lt;/a&gt;. It&#xA;was an easy 45 minute drive on the ring road, and we parked at the cafe at the&#xA;trailhead. The countryside was classic Iceland. On the ride home, Jessica mused&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I wonder if Icelandic has a specific word for &amp;lsquo;moss-covered rockscape&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Home?,&amp;rdquo; I jokingly speculated. &amp;ldquo;You can work out which meaning from the&#xA;context.&amp;rdquo; Silly, but it&amp;rsquo;s striking to realize how these alien landscapes are&#xA;simply normal reality for people here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025-06-29 Arrival in Reykjavik</title>

      <guid>https://jbandlow.github.io/2025-06-29-arrival-in-reykjavik/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Awoke on Saturday the 28th to a message that our flight was delayed, from&#xA;11:10am to 2:30pm, and was presented with the option to switch flights. Since&#xA;this made for a very tight connection in NY, I switched, though the best I&#xA;could switch to was a 2:00pm. While in the airport lounge waiting for that&#xA;flight, I saw that it was also delayed (until at least 3:00pm), and so I&#xA;immediately switched back to the original flight. Through this process, we lost&#xA;our Comfort+ seats on the original and ended up across the aisle from one&#xA;another in the very back of the plane. We were further delayed on the runway&#xA;before takeoff, and again on landing, making it look like the connection was&#xA;going to be a &amp;ldquo;run and hope&amp;rdquo; kind of thing. But it turned out that flight was&#xA;also delayed by an hour and so we reasonably easily left NY at ~1:00am. These&#xA;were main cabin seats more towards the front of the plane, and were somewhat&#xA;more comfortable, but still not great for a red-eye. In any case, we got some&#xA;patchy sleep and arrived without issue. Entering Iceland was easy, though there&#xA;was quite a long line to pick up the rental car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
