      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we were both up, we enjoyed an amazing breakfast at the hotel. This was&#xA;an open buffet of bread, sliced meats, smoked salmon, salad, yoghurts, etc.,&#xA;with an included carafe of coffee. Given Icelandic prices, we could easily have&#xA;had the equivalent of a $100 meal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After some discussion, we decided our plan for the day was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://siggadottir.com/reykjadalur-hot-springs/&#34;&gt;Reykjadalur Hot&#xA;Springs Hike&lt;/a&gt;. After getting&#xA;sorted, we left around 11:30 for&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hverager%C3%B0i,+Iceland/&#34;&gt;Hveragerdi&lt;/a&gt;. It&#xA;was an easy 45 minute drive on the ring road, and we parked at the cafe at the&#xA;trailhead. The countryside was classic Iceland. On the ride home, Jessica mused&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I wonder if Icelandic has a specific word for &amp;lsquo;moss-covered&amp;rsquo; rockscape.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Home?,&amp;rdquo; I speculated. &amp;ldquo;You can work out which meaning from the context.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Silly, but it&amp;rsquo;s striking to realize how these alien landscapes are simply&#xA;normal reality for people here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Awoke on Saturday the 28th to a message that our flight was delayed, from&#xA;11:10am to 2:30pm, and was presented with the option to switch flights. Since&#xA;this made for a very tight connection in NY, I switched, though the best I&#xA;could switch to was a 2:00pm. While in the airport lounge waiting for that&#xA;flight, I saw that it was also delayed (until at least 3:00pm), and so I&#xA;immediately switched back to the original flight. Through this process, we lost&#xA;our Comfort+ seats on the original and ended up across the aisle from one&#xA;another in the very back of the plane. We were further delayed on the runway&#xA;before takeoff, and again on landing, making it look like the connection was&#xA;going to be a &amp;ldquo;run and hope&amp;rdquo; kind of thing. But it turned out that flight was&#xA;also delayed by an hour and so we reasonably easily left NY at ~1:00am. These&#xA;were main cabin seats more towards the front of the plane, and were somewhat&#xA;more comfortable, but still not great for a red-eye. In any case, we got some&#xA;patchy sleep and arrived without issue. Entering Iceland was easy, though there&#xA;was quite a long line to pick up the rental car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
