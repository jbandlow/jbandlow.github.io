  <p>As our trip comes to a close, today we completed the pilgrimage that the two of
us have discussed for a very long time &ndash; a visit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram_Museum">Fram Museum of Polar
Exploration</a> in Oslo. It exceeded our
already high expectations. The exhibits were detailed and very well-curated.
The central, but by no means only, experience was walking around, on, and
through the great ship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram_(ship)">Fram</a>. They
also have an excellent <a href="https://frammuseum.no/shop/">shop</a>, with many books and
items commissioned specifically for the Museum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll save my repetition of all that I love about these stories, and just say
that it was a wonderful capstone to what has been a lovely trip.</p>
