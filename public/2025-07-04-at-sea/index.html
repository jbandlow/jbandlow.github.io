  <p>The 4th of July was very much a &ldquo;ship day&rdquo;. No land or other ships would have
been visible all day, even if visibility had been perfect, which it very much
was not. The captain gives a daily announcement at noon with general conditions.</p>
<p>From today&rsquo;s announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are at 74'39&quot; North, 0'28&quot; West, in the Greenland Sea</li>
<li>Current temperature is 46 degrees F</li>
<li>We still have some whales following us</li>
<li>The sea is calm</li>
<li>There is an overcast sky with patchy fog</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, on that last point, we heard the foghorn blow intermittently
throughout the day.</p>
<p>There have been several shipboard lectures on topics including the history of
the Vikings, the geography of the places we&rsquo;re going, modern aquaculture in the
area, etc. These can be watched live from an auditorium on board (the Star
Theater), or watched from the TV in our cabin after the fact. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying
a few of those, and Jessica has joined up with a crafting group of people on
board doing knitting, beading, watercolor, etc. There&rsquo;s also the gym, the pools
and hot tubs, the sauna, etc., as well as substantial eating and drinking
options. Between that and getting this blog set up, I was more than able to to
pass the time.</p>
<p>One of our go to dining locations is the World Cafe, which is a large buffet
with some permanent options (sushi, crab, salmon, pizza, etc.), but also has a
daily theme from various countries. Today&rsquo;s feature was the USA, with choices
including: avocado toast, deviled eggs with caviar, corn on the cob, red beans
and rice, &ldquo;California&rdquo; swordfish tacos, Alaskan halibut, hushpuppies, and more.</p>
