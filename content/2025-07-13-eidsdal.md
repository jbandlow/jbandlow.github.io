Today we were in [Eidsdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidsdal), and it was
definitely the most beautiful day of the trip so far. The weather was sunny an
nearing 80 degrees. Eidsdal is a very small farming town, without a port big
enough to accommodate our ship. So to visit, we anchored at sea, and there were
periodic tender boats (basically our lifeboats) shuttling folks to shore.

The main activity for the day was a self-organized hike. Jessica joined for the
first part, and fed some sheep that we passed the good stuff that they had
cleared from their pasture and couldn't reach through the fence. But after a
while she decided to head back and get a little more rest and recovery today,
especially given the steepness and poor footing of the trail we were on.

I continued on and got to a small lake and a local high point before heading
back. The hiking tended to be one of two flavors: steeply uphill, or wandering
through farmer's pasture lands. Nevertheless, it was stunning. I'll let the
photos tell the story.

The time at sea both before and after our time on shore was also strikingly
beautiful. To be in such rugged, mountainous countryside, and yet just gliding
gently along the water is a bit surreal.
