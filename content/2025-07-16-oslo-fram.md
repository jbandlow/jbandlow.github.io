As our trip comes to a close, today we completed the pilgrimage that the two of
us have discussed for a very long time -- a visit to the [Fram Museum of Polar
Exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram_Museum) in Oslo. It exceeded our
already high expectations. The exhibits were detailed and very well-curated.
The central, but by no means only, experience was walking around, on, and
through the great ship [Fram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram_(ship)). They
also have an excellent [shop](https://frammuseum.no/shop/), with many books and
items commissioned specifically for the Museum.

I'll save my repetition of all that I love about these stories, and just say
that it was a wonderful capstone to what has been a lovely trip.
