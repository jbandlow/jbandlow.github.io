Today was the final day of this great trip. We treated it as a bonus day, since
with the Fram Museum yesterday, we had done everything we hoped. After the
luxurious breakfast at our hotel (Scandinavian hotels really seem to do this
well!) we headed out to the [Historical
Museum](https://www.historiskmuseum.no/english/). This had a lot of interesting
historical artifacts, including Viking-age collections, as well as a lot of
items from areas and time periods that had little to do with Scandinavia.
Jessica and I were both a bit confused about the point of certain exhibits and
the very little context we were given about what was present. That said, there
were still some fun objects like traditional snow-goggles, Fridtjof Nansen's
Nobel prize, and a beautiful pre-Viking sword.

In the afternoon Jessica completed the last item on her list by spending time at
a Norwegian knitting store, while I went to visit [Frogner
Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogner_Park), to see the
[Vigeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Vigeland) sculpture garden. It
was a lot of fun.

We finished the day with one last "high tea" back at the hotel restaurant,
another lovely Northern European tradition.
