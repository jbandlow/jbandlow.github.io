This is a blog for a summer 2025 trip my wife and I took, centered around a
Norwegian cruise. The setup is simple so I can blog while at sea. Every day
I'll try to post some short notes on the day, along with a link to a Google
Photos album with a few pictures. As I have time and energy, I'll update the
older pages and photos.

* Day 1: [Arrival in Reykjavik](2025-06-29-arrival-in-reykjavik/)
* Day 2: [Hiking in Reykjadalur](2025-06-30-reykjadalur-and-djupagilsfoss/)
