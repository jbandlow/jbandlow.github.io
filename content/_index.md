This is a blog for a summer 2025 trip my wife and I took, centered around a
Norwegian cruise. The setup is simple so I can blog while at sea. Every day
I'll try to post some short notes on the day, along with a link to a Google
Photos album with a few pictures. As I have time and energy, I'll update the
older pages and photos.
